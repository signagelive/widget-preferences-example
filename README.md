# Widget Preferences Example
An example widget demonstrating all preference types and validation properties

It uses [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org) to help create modular code and [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) to load the configuration and interact with the DOM

To test this widget in Signagelive:
1. Zip up all of the folders and index.html and config.xml
2. You can call it anything you wish
3. Change the File Extension to .wgt
4. Upload to Signagelive
5. Add to an playlist 
6. If you look at the prefences by double clicking the asset in the playlist you will see that the Signagelive UI renders appropriate controls and enforces the validation that is set
7. Change any values you wish - you can check the validation rules here!
8. Save the playlist
7. Publish the playlist to your Signagelive Player
8. You will see a print out of all the preferences and the updated values
